# OnBoard - Backend

## About

This is my capstone project for college.
I have seperated it out into 3 repositories so as to prevent a clutter of files.

[capstone-client, capstone-server, capstone-test]

The client and server are the frontend and backend respectively,
and each may hold some unit tests and integration tests specific to either the frontend or the backend.

Any integration tests will be located in the tests repo.

Documentation - mockups, ERD, class diagrams are currently in my private DropBox.

They may be moved into their own repo at the end of this to showcase all parts of this project.

## Areas of Focus

-   Node / Express
-   TypeScript
-   CI/CD
-   AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, EC2, ACM)

## Environment

-   Env variables must be loaded into the Elastic Beanstalk (I believe)
